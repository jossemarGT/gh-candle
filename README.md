# GH Candle 🕯️

Generate contribution graphs "shadows" from other GitHub accounts *that belong to you*.

Let's say by whims of fate, you had to create one or more separate GitHub
accounts that reflect most of your activity, and now your personal one looks so
sad. Then you wonder if only there was a way to synchronize GH contribution
graphs... Well, say no more! Although there is no official way to do so, there
are ways to mimic it with *GH candle* 🕯️.
